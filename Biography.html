        John Von Neumann was born on December 28, 1903 in Budapest, Hungary with the name of János Neumann.
        His mother's name is Margit Kann (Margaret Kann) who came from a family that sold farming equipment and his father is Miksa Neumann (Max Neumann) who was a banker. 
        He grew up in a highly assimilated Jewish family. He was a child prodigy growing up as he could joke in classical Greek and also could recite numbers and addresses from a phonebook with once short glace. 
        Neumann learned different languages and math from tutors. He also attended one of Budapest's most prestigious secondary schools, the Lutheran Gymnasium. 
        Neuman and his family fled from Béla Kun's short lived communist regime to a spot in between Vienna and the Adriatic resort of Abbazia(now Opatija, Croatia.). 
        He was discouraged from pursuing a math career by his father as he was afraid that there wasn't going to be much money made in that field. He ended up studying both Math and Chemistry and got a degree in chemical engineering from the swiss Institute in Zürich and a doctorate in math from the university of Budapest.
        Von Neumann was known for his intelligence and memory from an early age. Von Neumann published about 150 papers in his lifetime, including 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60 in applied mathematics. 
        His last work, an unfinished manuscript from The hospital that was later published under the title The Computer and the Brain, showed the direction of his interests in the last days of his life. 
        He has worked at Princeton University, Princeton Institute for Advanced Study and other institutions.
