		<p>In June 1945, von Neumann, Goldstein, Burkes and others jointly published a 101-page report, the famous "101-page report" in the history of computer science, which is a milestone in the development of modern computer science. It is clearly stipulated that binary instead of decimal operation, and the computer is divided into five major components, this excellent idea has laid the foundation for the logical structure design of electronic computers, and has become the basic principle of computer design. In 1951, the EDVAC computer was announced. Due to the need for a large number of operations in the Manhattan project, von Neumann used the two most advanced computers at that time, Mark I and ENIAC. In the process of using Mark I and ENIAC, he realized the importance of stored programs and proposed the stored program logic architecture. Although von Neumann's concept is very new, the term von Neumann structure is unfair to von Neumann's partners, contemporaries, and even earlier generations.</p>

        <p>The main features of the stored program computer in the architecture are:</p><br>
                <p>The computing unit is the center</p>
                <p>The principle of stored program is adopted</p>
                <p>Memory is an address-accessed, linearly addressed space</p>
                <p>The control flow is generated by the instruction flow</p>
                <p>Instruction consists of an operation code and an address code</p>
                <p>The data is encoded in binary</p>
